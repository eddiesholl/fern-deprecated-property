## What are the Carbon Calculator APIs?

The Carbon Calculator APIs are a set of APIs that allow you to calculate the carbon emissions of various agricultural activities. The APIs are designed to be easy to
use and integrate into your existing systems.

You can perform calculations for a range of different agricultural activities.

## Versioning

The Carbon Calculator APIs are versioned. This means that when we make changes to the API, we will release a new version. You can specify the version of the API you
want to use in your requests, guaranteeing that if you always use the same version, your code will continue to work as expected, and you'll get the same results you
received the last time you ran the calculation.

On each endpoint, the version is indicated in the URL, for example, in this URL:

https://emissionscalculator-mtls.production.exampleapi.com/calculator/v1/sheepbeef

The version number is `v1`.

## Getting Started

First learn how to authenticate with the API and [get your certificate and private key](/authentication-and-certificates).

Then locate the specific documentation for that endpoint(s) you would like to use and get started:
